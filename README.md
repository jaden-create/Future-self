# hello-world
First repository
Hi Humans!
This is my first repository I made on febuary 3rd, 2021
I am getting back into coding after not doing much during quarentine except for 3 on 3 hockey and school for gr.10. But I am getting back into it, I did the waterloo CCC practice test for juniors 2020 edition. I couldn't do the 5th question, I hope when you read this in the future you laugh at how easy of the question you struggled with was. Anyways I hope you achieved everything you ever dreamed of, and if you haven't, don't give up, don't settle. You/I are special and are here to change the world.
Anyways see you in the future man when you look in a mirror?
